The Main.java contains code for 11 pattern problems, The patterns are mentioned in Patterns.txt file.
Learning to write logic for these patterns is important becasue by building the logic for these patterns we can understand
and master the loops and also improve our logic thinking and logic building skills.
Try to see the pattern and build the logic without looking at the code but if you get stuck anywhere the solution for every 
pattern is provided in Main.java code. The code might be in Java but the logic will be same for the patterns in all the 
programming languages.
Enjoy learning.
